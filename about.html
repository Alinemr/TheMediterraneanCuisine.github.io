<b>The history of Mediterranean Cuisine dates back to 9 BC.( Essid, M.Y.2012, p 57) and some vital aspects have influenced the development of Mediterranean diet throughout history.<br> I agree with (Essid, M.Y. 2012, p 52) who stated that several constraints should be considered in order to comprehend the history of Mediterranean Cuisine,<br> for example political situations, natural disasters, cultural interactions, and also change in life styles.<br>
<br>
<br>

Mediterranean cuisine comprises of multiple constituents, particularly fruits and vegetables, olive oil, dairy, and meat products.<br> Consequently, Mediterranean cuisine, through various findings, has been proven to be beneficial in terms of lowering the risk of various diseases. <br>
Moreover, (Altomare et al 2013, 449) suggested that the Mediterranean cuisine, however rudimentary in terms of its primary ingredients,<br> offers a multitude of dishes and tastes that have been utilised for many centuries. Furthermore, (Altomare et al 2013, 449 ) proposed that the cuisine is<br> one that has conformed to various ethnicities that pertain to the Mediterranean Basin. </b><br>
